Initial Setup
-------------
Please see wiki article: https://sites.google.com/a/amee.cc/knowledge-base/home/overbury/initial-setup

Code notes
----------
- AmeeCarbonStore#amee_profile_item_field assumes the field entered is going to be a number.  If the application is extended to support fields that are non-numbers this area will need to be revisited
- Material::Type[:particle_board] is called "Chipboard" as only UK market at the moment.  In the US this is called "Particle Board"


Future work
-----------
- For types where extra fields are required (for example waste) the METHOD hash uses a name
  inferred from the key name converted to a string and capitalised.  Whilst this works well
  in this example, it is unsure whether this well for future additions.  A fuller solution
  may need to be explored using an approach similar to TYPE
- A user account isn't tied to a client but currently the only way to add a user to projects
  is to be associated with an existing client project.  Therefore we need a way to match
  user on email at create time (and if exists in system skip straight to user_roles page) or 
  allow a user to request access to a client.  Also the roles list should remove roles that
  the viewing user isn't allowed to see.
- Add a client admin through the UI - may need to look at RolesController#create code.
- We've assumed one client admin and one project owner but not hard coded this.  This means
  if you have more than one for each of these roles they can remove each other.  Not sure if
  this is a good idea or not.
