# TODO project validations
# TODO once created project, need to add user
# TODO requirements - reporting, calculations per floor area etc.  Do need?
# TODO chase data in amee as depending how done can hold up (mappings area) + client choose units
# TODO is way to have include out of models?
# TODO create two in a minute - blows up like a volcano.  Can used named items apparently (speak to Paul)
# TODO user.rb TODO items
# TODO write tests for access rights.  Also go through auth system and specs for (made changes)
# TODO flash messages and model error methods
# TODO work on UI
# TODO cap and cap-multistaging
# TODO amee gem version, json so faster
# TODO front page needs to warn if no JS (can view but not create)
# TODO test not-allowed 404s in prod

# - Assumptions on types
#     What to use for freight train?
#     LGV, HGV, articulated classifications - will be updated (email Andy)
#     materials - notes in model
#     waste mappings [+ do create, update, delete, check AMEE stored data test as can't do for this atm]
#       also this has recycle/dispose which is a big requirement depending how implemented in AMEE
#Â       looks like want volume for material.  Is that possible?
# - Also we need to check units everything specified in make sense (eg liquid petrol and gas measured in same?) [some hints in dynamic50 stories]
# 
# Had to cache carbon data for each item and purge at weekend when plenty of time
# Can't cache by category as transport spans multiple classes = major fail
# Other factors paging through results and manual ask for carbon value each time update or delete

# AMEE badly documented:
# - data/profile category
# - metadata
# - no docs on type, limits and validations
