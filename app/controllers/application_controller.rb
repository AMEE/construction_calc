# TODO notes in project.rb
# TODO re-read paper docs - check got all requirements covered
# TODO is way to have include out of models?
# TODO auth errors throw something else and treat as 404
# TODO create two in a minute - will it blow up??  Yes
# TODO user.rb TODO items
# TODO whole user access/creation area - can use system use by unboxed and others for admin?
# TODO write tests for access rights and test myself
# TODO type mappings, not available = can't have, recycle/dispose types
# TODO work on UI
# TODO cap and cap-multistaging
# TODO amee gem version, json so faster
#Â TODO Go through auth system and specs for

# - Assumptions on types
#     What to use for freight train?
#     LGV, HGV, articulated classifications - will be updated (email Andy)
#     materials - notes in model
#     waste mappings [+ do create, update, delete, check AMEE stored data test as can't do for this atm]
# - Also we need to check units everything specified in make sense (eg liquid petrol and gas measured in same?) [some hints in dynamic50 stories]
# 
# Had to cache carbon data for each item and purge at weekend when plenty of time
# Can't cache by category as transport spans multiple classes = major fail
# Other factors paging through results and manual ask for carbon value each time update or delete

# AMEE badly documented:
# - data/profile category
# - metadata
# - no docs on type, limits and validations
