# TODO unapproved assumptions: 
#       - ceiling tiles split into metal and mineral fibre in materials
#       - combined paper&card in waste
#       - split out ferrous&non-ferrous metals in waste
#       - split out cans and bottles in waste
# TODO have possible... - good idea?  Note on method if ok to override.  Also is better way to do this?

# TODO *****remaining assumptions email*****
# TODO deploy - setup default project dates, check value is a number, check need to enter number for floor area
# TODO cronjob
# TODO change units first it goes back to default if then change waste type option
# TODO 100% height causing a problem when ajax expands to be greater than window height
# TODO go through digs doc and check.  Add notes from readme to wiki and reference there?
# TODO create two in a minute - blows up like a volcano.  Can used named items apparently (speak to Paul) or just have limitation on site
# TODO reporting pdf
# TODO UAT - want assumptions sending to them?  Also have unapproved assumptions

# TODO password reset, roles, users screens - IE7/8 test
# TODO when new/edit for a type and it fails doesn't show form [can sort this somehow].  Also when creating new
#      adds an item should show list.  Can do all this with JS somehow - eg on success render partial list
#Â TODO edit, delete buttons have spacing on table index
# TODO destroy project
# TODO project#google_chart_image tidy up
# TODO on profile create add /metadata to profile with UK country (even though default)
# TODO is way to have include out of models?
# TODO calendar got white bit on bottom in IE.  Demo on their site works fine though
# TODO signup, password reset emails text
# TODO write up wiki page
# TODO email from local server - seems to work but should check how it's working
# TODO setup amee.yml info needed to run against production
# TODO Also we need to check units everything specified in make sense (eg liquid petrol and gas measured in same?) [some hints in dynamic50 stories]
# TODO front page needs to warn if no JS support in browser
# TODO write tests for access rights - see RolesControllerSpec for progress

# - Assumptions on types
#     What to use for freight train?
#     materials - ceiling tile data
#     looks like want volume for material.  Is that possible?
#     waste mappings

# Leasons learnt:
#  - AJAX can slow things up when time is tight
#  - need to get client category to amee categories mapped out up front
#
# AMEE badly documented:
# - data/profile category
# - metadata
# - no docs on type, limits and validations
